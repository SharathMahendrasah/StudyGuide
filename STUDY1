Study Guide Answer Sheet

1. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

2. In a distributed version control system the whole repository is fully mirrored meaning if the server goes down anyone of the client repositories can be used. Whereas if a centralized version control system were to fail then everyone and everything comes to a stop for as long as that server is down. The files are not mirrored anywhere and are just on the server for multiple people to collaborate on. 

3. It allows a user or users to see what changes have been made to a project. If there was an error on a newer iteration of a commit, a person is able to go back and see where that error occurred. 

4. A commit is when a user saves a document locally using git. When a user commits usually the user has to include a short comment as to what has changed since the previous iteration. 

5. A git check out updates files in the directory to match the iteration of the one in the index or the edited file.

6. A branch is when a user creates another iteration other than main in which that person can work on without messing with the main. This allows the user to experiment and if something goes wrong they can always go back to the main line since that was not changed.

7. Branches in git can exist for as long as a user wants it to. A branch will only cease to exist if a user inputs in the terminal that they no longer want the branch.
